The PFA Players’ Player of the Year nominees for the 2018/19 Premier League season have been announced today and Chelsea’s Eden Hazard was deservedly included on that list.

Hazard was the only nominee that did not come from title-contenders Manchester City and Liverpool, which says a lot about his form this season.

The Belgian captain was joined by Sergio Agüero, Bernardo Silva, and Raheem Sterling (all Manchester City) and Liverpool duo Virgil van Dijk and Sadio Mané.
Hazard has (so far) been directly involved in 28 goals in the Premier League in 2018/19 (16 goals and 12 assists); the most of any player.

With these numbers – along with finally playing in an attack-minded team under current Head Coach Maurizio Sarri – Hazard is undoubtedly in the form of his life.

And it’s not just his peers who believe this, ex-players feel this way about Hazard’s form this season…

“Hazard is the best player in the country to watch. I am not a Chelsea fan but a Hazard fan. Every time I see Chelsea I just say ‘give him the ball’. He is so tight with his play.
