Welcome to The OutRoar.\
First, with everything going on around the world, I hope you are fine as you read this. REMEMBER TO STAY HOME AND SAVE LIVES.  


This is a football-based website that will mainly focus on the Chelsea football club. I am a Chelsea fan and I have been since I was a little boy. Frank Lampard and Didier Drogba are one of the reasons I became a Chelsea fan. I enjoyed watching them and it brought me a lot of joy. And by end of the 2004/2005 season, I had come to love the Chelsea football club even though I was still a little boy with almost zero knowledge of football.

My passion for Chelsea and football is what brought me to creating this website. This website will include posts about transfer news, match reviews, loan watch and all things associated with Chelsea. I will also be adding a quiz section where you will test your knowledge about Chelsea football club, premier league and football in general. 
Just like most football fans, I love playing FIFA, so, occasionally I will post about EA Sports FIFA. This will include game reviews, tips, and tricks on how to play better.

I want this project to be a success and I will appreciate any kind of help. Feel free to reach out if you have any suggestions or if you would like to be part of the outRoar. Visit the contact page to see how you can reach me. Iâ€™m mostly active on Twitter and we can always interact there. Please share for reach and follow the outRoar on social media platforms. This will be highly appreciated.\
Again, WELCOME TO THE OUTROAR
