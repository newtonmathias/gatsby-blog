TOTS is the biggest event in FIFA ultimate team. It the one time playing the game is rewarding. It even bigger when the Premier League team of the season is in packs. Today at 6 pm UK time, EA Sports will release the premier league team of the season so far. This will be the best and most anticipated squad because the premier league has so many good players.  I’m going to focus on a few things that will be impacted by the release of the premier league team of the season so far.
### PREMIER LEAGUE TOTSSF PREDICTION
I Have seen a lot of leaks going around social media about who is going to be in premier league TOTSSF. It could be true but it isn’t that hard to predict the premier league team of the season. According to this season’s performance, the defenders may be Virgil Van Dijk, Trent Alexander Arnold, Andrew Robertson, and Soyuncu. Midfielders we could get Kevin De Bruyne and Henderson. The attack could feature Sergio Aguero, Mohammed Salah, Sadio Mane, and Aubameyang. Considering Alisson’s injury Pope could be the goalkeeper but I still think it will be Alisson. Other players who had a good season and could also feature in TOTSSF include Heung Min Son, Mateo Kovacic, Adama Traore, Richarlison, Jimenez, Marcus Rashford, and Tammy Abraham. Some players will be introduced in SBCs and player objectives.
### WEEKEND LEAGUE
This is probably going to be the sweatiest weekend of the season. With TOTSSF premier league players in packs, everybody will be playing and trying to get at least Elite 3. TOTS is usually very rewarding and people who reach Elite make millions off reward especially with premier league TOTS. Last weekend’s gameplay was bad and probably going to be worse this week. EA Sports haven’t fixed their server issues, and with everybody playing this weekend the gameplay will bad and delayed. It's advisable not to play your games on Friday as pros will be trying to get a high skill rating for the top 100.
### MARKET
With a big event like TOTS, the market will be crazy. Some prices will go up others will go down. If you invested in 86s you are probably going to make a lot of money when the player SBC drops. You can still invest during lighting rounds at 6 pm. Some big cards could drop massively when those players get a TOTSSF card. We could see another market crash maybe not.  I wish you all best of luck in the weekend league and stay safe.
