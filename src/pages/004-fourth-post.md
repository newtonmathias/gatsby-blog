It's been reported that Coutinho has been offered to Chelsea among other clubs. This move could see the Brazilian winger make his return to the premier league. The La Liga giants Barcelona signed Phillipe Coutinho from Liverpool back in January 2018 for 145m. Currently, Coutinho is on loan at Bayern Munich until the end of the season. Bayern Munich is not interested in signing the winger permanently.

Chelsea seems closet to signing Phillipe Coutinho as it is reported that they are negotiating with Barcelona. Chelsea fears they might miss out on Jadon Sancho. Barcelona is also interested in Chelsea’s midfielder N’golo Kante. There is a possibility of a swap deal plus cash. Ideally, a loan deal with an option to buy would perfect for Chelsea.
Coutinho plays as an attacking midfielder or a winger. Here are some of Coutinho’s stats:

| club          | Appearances | goals | assists |
|---------------|-------------|-------|---------|
| Liverpool     | 201         | 54    | 45      |
| Fc barcelona  | 76          | 21    | 11      |
| Inter Milan   | 47          | 5     | 4       |
| Bayern Munich | 32          | 9     | 8       |

I think Chelsea should only consider a loan deal with option buy. Current Chelsea squad has players with big potential like Pulisic, Hudson Odoi, Mason Mount, and the latest signing Hakim Ziyech.  Coutinho wouldn’t be a massive upgrade to Chelsea’s attack because what Chelsea needs is a right-winger. Signing a right-winger, a left-back, and a center back should be the priority.
