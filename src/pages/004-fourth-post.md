“Sarriball” the term first heard in Serie A is representation of Maurizio Sarri’s footballing philosophy. Interpretation of Sarriball is a fast; possession based playing style where Goal Keeper acts as a reference point to start the build-up play from defence. Outfield players are then expected to create a triangle shape formation on pitch with interchange of passes, and the last pass releasing a player to ensure vertical penetration in the opposition box.

Defensive component of Sarriball is to align off the ball movements without possession to cut out passing lanes/zones, and force opposition passes laterally instead through the middle to minimise goal scoring opportunities.

Maurizio Sarri was hired as Chelsea manager with the intent to change their philosophy and play the conventional term “Beautiful Football”. On the contrary, intent of change and results of change are not in alignment.

I have analysed four potential issues below to derive a conclusive summary on why Sarriball is not working as expected at Chelsea:

Problem 1 – Failure to accommodate reference points of domestic league

For any new coach in the Premier League, it is important to stick to their basic fundamentals, but to also accommodate vital references points which are requirements of league.

A classic example of this is the use of Fernandinho by Pep Guardiola. Though Pep’s fundamental style of play is possession based, he has not restricted the dirty tackling work of Fernandinho. With the Premier League being a high tempo league where 90% teams play on counter attack, a box-to-box Defensive midfielder is a vital reference point that any new coach should not miss. Pep has groomed Fernandinho’s passing skills and also allows him to do his box-to-box role to mitigate opposition counter attack.

Sarri on the other hand wants his possession based philosophy to be dictated by a Regista/Deep lying play maker instead of a pure defensive midfielder.

With the philosophy implementation at a pre-mature stage in this first season, every instance of lost possession triggers an opposition counter attack. Jorginho with all his technical passing ability, struggles to contain opposition counter attacks. Failure to contain counter attacks does not give defensive stability to the team. Above all, the ability of a Regista is to control the tempo of Chelsea’s play, but he has often been man marked out of the game by many oppositions and unable to do this.
