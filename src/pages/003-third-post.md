Next season will be Frank Lampard’s real test as Chelsea manager. The signings frank will make will be crucial and his success at Chelsea may depend on it. The current Chelsea squad is not good enough and cannot do well against good teams in the premier league like Manchester City and Liverpool. Making the right signings can and will bring good things to Chelsea. We all saw what happened with Klopp’s Liverpool. They made some good signings like Alisson and Virgil van Dijk and later went on to win the champions league. Here are some of the players I think Chelsea should sign before the next season:
### Jadon Sancho
At the age of just 20 years, Jadon Sancho has already established himself as a top footballer in Europe. Sancho is one of the most promising youngsters in the world of football. Chelsea hasn’t had a good right winger for a very long time. Jadon Sancho would solve all Chelsea right-wing problems. In just 23 appearances in 2019-20 Bundesliga season, Jadon Sancho has scored 14 goals and registered 15 assists. That’s just incredible. Manchester United are also interested in signing the young winger. Chelsea has better chances of signing Sancho as he grew up supporting Chelsea. Also, Chelsea has good chances of having champions league football next season. If Chelsea signs Sancho, that would Chelsea best signing since Eden Hazard, and we all know how that turned out.
### Timo Werner
Timo Werner would be another great signing for Chelsea. He is just 24 years old. He is a very good finisher and is mostly known for his pace and pace really hurts defenses. He is also good at getting in behind defenders and creating space in deep-lying positions. In the current Bundesliga season, Timo Werner has already scored 21 goals in 25 appearances and has made 7 assists. Chelsea has striker problems Since Didier Drogba and only Diego Costa managed 20 league goals in a premier league season. Tammy Abraham is good and Promising, and he and Werner competing for the position might bring the out the best. We’ve seen successful strike partnerships before even at Chelsea e.g. Floyd Hasselbaink and Eidur Gudjohnsen.
### Alex Telles
Chelsea has been unable to replace Ashley Cole at the left-back position. One of the reasons why Chelsea's defense is poor is the lack of a decent left-back. Alex Telles is an offensive left-back who currently plays for the Portuguese club, Porto. The 27 years old Brazilian has a high attacking and defensive work rate. He is also very fast and can keep up with pacey wingers. Chelsea needs to prioritize signing a good left-back and Alex Telles is the man for the job.
### Kalidou Koulibaly
Kalidou Koulibaly would improve the Chelsea defense significantly. He is very good at tackling and a real threat in the air. He is also fast and this can be very frustrating for attackers. Having a defender with such qualities can improve a team's defense massively. Kalidou Koulibaly is also a good leader as he captains the Senegal national team.
