Chelsea goalkeeper Kepa has been speaking about his colleague Eden Hazard, and the Basque stopper called his teammate the “best player in the Premier League.”

Kepa must get to see a lot of the winger’s magic in training, so perhaps it’s no surprise that he puts the Belgian up there at the very pinnacle of Premier League stars.

There is certainly some strong competition out there this year, and while some of the contenders have been more consistent than Eden at times, few, if any, can say they’ve produced the same number of moments of pure magic.
Raheem Sterling has had a superb season arriving at the back post to tuck away open goals, but even he can’t match Eden when it comes to the number of times he had neutrals on their feet applauding.

If he does leave this summer, we can look back on a truly special 7 years, where he has brought us plenty of frustration, but unmatched joy too.
