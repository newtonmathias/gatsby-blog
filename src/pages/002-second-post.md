Skill moves are very important in FIFA 20 as they can be used to create chances and score a lot of goals. Mastering some of the best skill moves in the game is one way of improving and playing better. This can help you get more wins in the weekend league, rise in the division rivals or be the better player when playing your friends offline in the kickoff mode. Knowing how to perform a skill move is easy, it is knowing when and where to perform that can be challenging.
### Ball Roll
This is a classic skill move that has been in the game for a very long time. It is easy to perform this skill move yet it is very effective. Ball roll is a 2-star skill move and most players in the game can perform it. To perform the ball roll, push the right analogue stick to the right or left of your player. The ball can be used to beat an opposing defender who is charging at your player, to set up a shot by putting the ball at the playerâ€™s strong foot and in some cases to beat a rushing goalkeeper.
### Drag Back
Drag back is a 2-star skill move. When performing the drag back, it offers you a lot of options. To perform the drag back, hold the R1 /RB button and move the left stick to the back of the player. You can do a full or half drag back, 180 or 90 degrees drag back. These variations make the move unpredictable and you can confuse your opponents by executing a different variation each time. The drag back is a must use skill move in your build-up play. Integrate different variations of the drag back in your play and you will become a better player.
### Fake shot
The fake shot is one of the easiest skills to learn yet one of the most important skill moves. The fake shot is a 1-star skill move. To  perform the fake shot, tap shot/cross button followed quickly by the pass button. Just like the drag back, the fake shot has many variations. You can use the fake shot to change direction or perform a fake shot stop. Performing a first touch fake shot while receiving a ball can be used to fool your opponent and set up a shot.
### Heel to heel
Heel to heel is a four-star skill which has been very overpowered in previous FIFA editions and is still a top skill move in FIFA 20. The heel to heel is performed by flicking the right analogue stick to the front and then to the back of your player. It is best used in one vs one situations or to exit a crowded box.
### Roulette
Diego Maradona and Zinedine Zidane, arguably one of the greatest footballers of all time, are some of the players that made the roulette famous. Just as it is effective in real life, the roulette is also one of the best skill moves that can be used to beat a defender in FIFA 20. To perform this 3-star skill move, rotate the right stick 270 degrees from the bottom. This is also one of the most underrated skill moves in my opinion. You should try it out.\
There a lot of useful skills moves in FIFA 20, but these are the top five skill moves that are also easy to master. For more tips and tricks follow me on twitter.
